</p>
<p><b> /// What does the CyReL CaTTamaran TT030 Accelerator do? </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>It will speed up your Atari TT030, giving you approximately 50%
more performance than a regular TT. It does this by speeding up the
main clock of your TT from 32 MHz (standard) to 48 MHz (accelerated).
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// What happened to the 40 MHz mode? [3] </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Originally, we thought the optimum we could achieve would be a
TT030 running at 40 MHz. However, during the development of the CyReL
CaTTamaran we discovered that we would be able to go all the way up to
48 MHz instead. Thus, the decision was made to drop the 40 MHz mode
and provide only the 32 MHz and 48 MHz modes.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// Does the CyReL CaTTamaran replace the MC68030 <a href="080108.htm" target="UDOcon">CPU</a> in my
TT? </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>No it does not. You do not have to purchase a new <a href="080108.htm" target="UDOcon">CPU</a>.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// Will the CyReL CaTTamaran speed up the FPU operations?
[3] </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Yes it does. You'll get up to 60% more FPU performance with the
CyReL CaTTamaran.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// Do I have to get a new FPU? [3] </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>No. You do not have to replace the <a href="080108.htm" target="UDOcon">CPU</a> nor the FPU. You simply
keep the components you have.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// Has the CyReL CaTTamaran any Cache memory? [2] </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>No it does not. The CyReL CaTTamaran utilizes the existing memory
in the best way possible while keeping the cost of the unit down.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// Do I have to buy new memory? </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>No. You do not have to add costly cache memory to your system. You
simply keep the memory already installed in your TT.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// Do I get a higher performance factor with faster RAMs ?
[2] </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>No. The CyReL CaTTamaran does not access the RAM itself. This is
being done by the <a href="080108.htm" target="UDOcon">CPU</a> and the Atari TT chipset. Thus, the CyReL
CaTTamaran cannot take advantage of faster RAM chips. However, we have
optimized the memory accesses, thus giving you up to 78% better access
times than the regular TT chipset will yield. [3]
<br>
</p>
<p>With a small modification, GE-Soft FastRAM boards can be optimized
for the operation with the CyReL CaTTamaran. Test results obtained
with GEM-Bench show that FastRAM access speeds can go up to 220%.[5]
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// Does the CyReL CaTTamaran work with FastRAM? </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Yes it does. So far, we have tested the CaTTamaran with FastRAM
modules from GE-Soft and Atari.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// Have there been any problems with FastRAM boards? [4]
</b>
<br>
</p>
<p>One customer reported that he was not able to get some older
GE-Soft boards working correctly with the CaTTamaran. Another reported
problems with a fully loaded 64 MB GE-Soft board. Some of these
troubles can be eliminated by using a higher rated power supply,
especially if the system has already been equipped with an ST-RAM
board, TT-RAM board and/or a graphics card. There are also some 'fine
tuning' instructions available from Cybercube to avoid such problems.
<br>
</p>
<p>Update: These problems have been eliminated. The latest CyReL
CaTTamaran revision now fully supports all TT-FastRAM sizes. [5]
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// Is there a 100% guarantee that it will work in my system?
[3] </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>No. We want you to understand that we cannot give you a 100%
assurance that it will work in every conceivable motherboard/expansion
board(s) combination. The CyReL CaTTamaran employs a bag full of
tricks to achieve the high performance level it provides. We have
exercised great care to insure the best possible compatibility, but as
with every other product, the risk to its use and installation lies
with the user. Please refer to the ordering details and our return
policy for more information about this issue.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// Will the CyReL CaTTamaran generate excessive heat? [2]
</b>
<br>
</p>
<p>No. During our extensive testing program we found that the heat
generated in the accelerated modes does not exceed the safety limits
nor does it damage any parts of your your TT.
<br>
</p>
<p>Several design steps have been integrated to insure that the CyReL
CaTTamaran accelerator unit will run as cool and as efficient as
possible.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// Will the CyReL CaTTamaran cause any damage to my TT? [2]
</b>
<br>
</p>
<p>No. We have tested the full operation of the CyReL CaTTamaran and
included special design features to guarantee that the proper usage of
the accelerator will not cause any damages or malfunctions.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// Does the CyReL CaTTamaran work with VME bus cards? </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Yes it does. But we can only guarantee the full compatibility with
our own line of VME bus boards, the CyReL Sunrise M16-1280 True Color
High Resolution Graphics cards, CyReL VidiMix16 <a href="0903.htm" target="UDOcon">Desktop</a> <a href="12.htm" target="UDOcon">Video</a> Modules,
CyReL MPT-16 Modules and the CyReL TrIDEnt IDE Interfaces.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// How can I find out if I can install a CyReL CaTTamaran in
my TT? </b>
</p>
<p>That depends mostly on your TT030 motherboard revision. To
establish which TT030 motherboard revision you have, you must open
your TT030. Please note that this may void your warranty. Once you
removed the cover (and any metal shielding), please check the lower
lefthand or righthand corner of your motherboard. Write down the
revision level usually found on a white sticker on the motherboard.
For a quick and easy installation, you should have at least REV. G.
<br>
</p>
<p>If you have a ST RAM memory expansion board, please check whether
the pins of the frontmost 96 pin DIN connector stick out at least 3
millimeters (about 1/10 of an inch) from the topside of the ST RAM
expansion board.
<br>
</p>
<p>Further, please ensure that those pins are clean and free of any
soldering residues. [2]
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// What if I do not find any revision index/label? [2] </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Several customers reported that they were unable to locate the
revision level sticker as indicated in the Q&amp;A paragraph above.
Here are a few hints how to identify your board revision level without
the sticker:
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>* please locate the <a href="080108.htm" target="UDOcon">CPU</a>. Is it surface mount (soldered directly to
the board) ? Look for a chip with the MC68030F33 labelling. If you
locate this chip on the right hand side of the board (underneath the
ST RAM expansion board) then you have one of the more recent board
revisions. If the <a href="080108.htm" target="UDOcon">CPU</a> is on the left hand side of the board or plugged
into a socket, or even on a daugtherboard, then you have one of the
older revisions. The installation in the older revision boards is a
little more involved, since it will require some soldering.
<br>
</p>
<p>* please check if your board has a three pin connector labelled
W101 (used to change the clock speed of the FPU). If you cannot find
this connector, you probably have one of the older revision boards.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// Does the CyReL CaTTamaran installation require soldering?
</b>
<br>
</p>
<p>It does not necessarily require soldering if you have a
motherboard revision REV.F or higher. Earlier motherboard revisions
will require soldering. [4]
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// What tools do I need to install the CyReL CaTTamaran?
</b>
<br>
</p>
<p>You will need a Phillips screwdriver, a flathead screwdriver (both
to remove the TT cover), pliers or any other tool to straighten the
tabs of the metal shielding (if any) for removal and a cutter to cut
one pin of a resistor.
<br>
</p>
<p>For a installation in older TT's, you will require a soldering
iron. [4]
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// Do I need any special expertise to install a CyreL
CaTTamaran? </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>No. Common sense is all that is required. If you know how to open
your TT, plug in a few plugs, you should be able to install a CyReL
CaTTamaran yourself. If you do not feel comfortable installing the
unit yourself, ask your nearest Atari dealer to perform this task for
you.
<br>
</p>
<p>The CyReL CaTTamaran comes with our highly acclaimed RUN-ME-FIRST
installation program that will demonstrate each installation step with
graphics and animations right on your screen BEFORE you start the
installation process. The same instructions are also included in
printed form to further facilitate the process. [2]
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// Does the CaTTamaran work with the older TT motherboard
revisions? [4] </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Yes. We have just released a new archive containing a 150 dpi GEM
image describing all the necessary modifications to install the CyReL
CaTTamaran in systems with the older motherboards (those that had a
<a href="080108.htm" target="UDOcon">CPU</a> daughterboard). This file will be made available via several
online services for your convenience.
<br>
</p>
<p>Please note that we included a complete set of benchmarks
(produced on such a system) below.
<br>
</p>
<p>Update: The CyReL CaTTamaran can now also be used in systems with
TT motherboard revision Rev. B (<a href="080108.htm" target="UDOcon">CPU</a> is in PGA package in a socket on
the left hand side of the board). [5]
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// Can I control the speed of the CyReL CaTTamaran? </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Yes you can. Each CyReL CaTTamaran comes complete with the CyReL
Dashboard utility. This accessory program allows you to switch at any
time from 32 MHz to 48 MHz or from 48 MHz back to 32 MHz.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// How compatible is the CyReL CaTTamaran? </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>The operation of the CyReL CaTTamaran if fully transparent.
Programs do not usually notice any difference when running at 48 MHz.
All programs tested so far ran without any problems. They simply
execute faster. However, we cannot give a 100% compatibility assurance
since it is virtually impossible to test every single program out
there in combination with the hundreds of utility and accessory
packages available for the Atari computers.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br><b> /// Which programs will benefit the most from the speed-up?
</b>
<br>
</p>
<p>The speed-up will be most apparent with programs that rely on <a href="080108.htm" target="UDOcon">CPU</a>
intensive tasks, like blitting, compressing, de-compressing,
converting, rasterizing, scrolling. Since the CyReL CaTTamaran speeds
up the FPU as well, programs that rely on FPU performance (like
DynaCADD or InShape) will be sped up too.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// How about some benchmarks? [2] </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Here are some PRELIMINARY figures. The benchmarks have been

</p>
<p>Here is the latest benchmark update. The CyReL CaTTamaran can be
operated in two modes, 32 MHz and 48 MHz. In 32 MHz mode, the CyReL
CaTTamaran yields exactly the same results like a standard TT030,
reporting around 100% for all the different test categories.
<br>
</p>
<p>Below you will find three different sets of benchmarks. The first
was taken on a TT030, equipped with FastRAM and the CyReL CaTTamaran

<p><b> /// Where can I get a CyReL CaTTamaran ? [3] </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>The CyReL CaTTamaran is shipping to a lot of dealers all over
North America right now. Please check with your nearest dealer for
availability. In case you are not able to get your CyReL CaTTamaran
Accelerator through your Atari dealer, please contact Cybercube
directly at the addresses provided below.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// How much do I have to add for Shipping and Handling ? [3]
</b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Please add $6.00 for S&amp;H (regular mail). We also offer
shipments via courier. For more details, please contact Cybercube
directly.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// Can I return the product if it will not work in my TT?
</b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Yes you can. We will offer a 10 days return policy. Please check
for details when ordering. Note that there is a handling fee involved
when returning the product. When you return the unit, we will refund
the cost of the unit minus 15%. [3]
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// Will any de-installation require soldering ? [3] </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Yes. In case the CyReL CaTTamaran might not work in your TT030,
and you decide to return it, you would have to solder the one
connection that had to be cut during the installation of the unit.
This is probably the best and most durable way to do it, but other
means of reconnecting that one connection can be devised in case you
do not have access to a soldering iron.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> /// Is there be a special GEnie topic for the CyReL

hardware category (set 4),then read all the latest news in the
CaTTamaran topic (rea 33 new). We would be happy to see you there and
provide any further assistance.

<br><b> Probleme mit dem Ram </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Bei einem Bekannten gab es noch Probleme mit dem Burst-Modus
(Original Atari-FastRAM). Abgeschaltet und alles lief. Entsprechenden
Jumper (W3 oder W105, je nach Karte) auf der Fastramkarte abziehen.
<br>
</p>
<p>Ansonsten ist die Streuung zwischen lief und lief nicht stabil
beim Cattamaran gro&szlig;. Zum Teil bestand die Meinung die
Anschl&uuml;sse anzul&ouml;ten. Irgendwer meinte auch die FPU
m&uuml;sste mit dem gleichen Takt laufen. Was aber theoretisch nicht
sein, weil die Kommunikation zwischen <a href="080108.htm" target="UDOcon">CPU</a> und FPU asynchron
l&auml;uft. Es wurde auch die Vermutung ge&auml;u&szlig;ert, da&szlig;
die Abst&uuml;rze von bestimmten Programmen oder deren Kombination
herkommen.
<br>
</p>
<p>So gro&szlig; soll der Geschwindigkeitsgewinn auch nicht sein,
da&szlig; es sich lohnt da tiefer zu bohren.
<br>
