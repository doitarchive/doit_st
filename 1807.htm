<p><b> Networking my STE </b>
<br>From David Wade
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<br><b> The Background </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Look guys, I know I am a complete NERD but hey, I enjoy it. Any
way I have had a pair of <a href="0305.htm" target="UDOcon">Atari ST</a> computers, an STE upgraded to 4Megs
and a MEGA2,* sat in my Radio Shack for a long time now. From time
time I would load up &quot;XENONII&quot; and have a quick bash. In the
past I had written programs for them to edit MIDI voices, but now they
are largley unused.
<br>
</p>
<p>I had often thought about using the STs on the internet but the
home network consists of a 3COM 3C891 Office Connect ISDN Router
connected into a small local network. So whilst I do have some
Terminal Adaptors (the ISDN equivalent of Modems) which can be used
with normal dial up software getting the ISDN bus near the STs* would
be a pain, and when they were on the net they would keep the other PCs
off it. (stop cheering at the back they might not all run windoze :-)
<br>
</p>
<p>However when I saw the message on &quot;comp.sys.atari.st&quot;
about making an adaptor to allow an NE2000 clone to be used to connect
an ST to a LAN I thought &quot;that sounds like its worth a go&quot;.
And when Lyndon Adams announced he was making them available for sale
(see http://hardware.atari.org)* that sounded even better.
<br>
</p>
<p>However of course his exams came along and delayed production so I
decided to have a go at building one. The following pages describe my
experiences along the way .....
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>1. Collecting the parts
<br>2. Building the interface
<br>3. Configuring the network
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<br><b> Collecting the <a href="0303.htm" target="UDOcon">Parts</a> </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>The interface consists the following parts.
<br>
</p>
<p>* A small PCB double sided PCB that fits in the Atari Cartridge
port
<br>* A larger PCB has a the ISA socket for the NE200 card and a small
chip to latch some signals.
<br>* A piece of 40-way ribbon to connect the above together
<br>* An ISA NE2000 clone card.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>The parts were obtained as follows:-
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<br><b> Ethernet card </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>A visit to a local comuter fair produced some RTL8019AS based
cards at 2 for &#163;5.00 so these were popped on in the shopping
basket.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br><b> Printed Circuits </b>
<br>As I don't have the facilites to make the PCBs the GIF files were
e-mailed to a friend who does, which produced me a couple of cards. As
you can see from the picture below these are a bit &quot;rough and
ready&quot;, but he did not charge me for them.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p align=center><img src="image/boards.gif" border=0 width="428" height="326"></p><br>
<div align=center><tt> Abbildung 1 - Die Platine </tt>
<br>
</div>
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> Electonic Components </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>The board requires a small number of what should be very common
components.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>* ISA Socket
<br>* 2 Capacitors
<br>* 1 Resistor
<br>* 1 x 74LS245 or 74HCT245
<br>* Ribbon Cable and headers or connectors.
<br>
</p>
<p>All of these items are in the Maplin catalog, but when I visited
my local store I was told the ICs are only available mail order. I did
pause to pick up the ISA socket as there was one on the shelf but
thought I would have the other parts, except the IC in the junk box.
Fortunatley there is a small dealer near me (Eclipse Electronic
Comonents, Cross Street, Sale) who had the IC in stock, so those to
went in the basket. Whilst there I also bought pair of 40-way right
angle PCB mount IDC connectors. These have enough connector exposed so
I could solder one row to the top of the small PCB and so get round
the problem of no plated through holes.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<br><b> Building the Interface </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Soldering the IDC Socket to the small PCB was fairly easy. However
I had forgotton how poor my close-in sight is, but frequent stops to
check with a magnifier produced a reasonable looking board. The second
board was a bit harder. The GIF in download ZIP does not clearly show
where all the links go, but after some drawing of lines with a ruler I
decided they should be as below:-
<br>

<p>

<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p align=center><img src="image/layout.gif" border=0 width="500" height="328"></p><br>
<div align=center><tt> Abbildung 3 - Die Schaltung des Interface </tt>
<br>
</div>
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Now I had the components assembled, the boards need to be linked
together and plugged into the ST* but could not see any assembly
instructions any where in the documentation and there are a number of
ways it could fit together. After some checks with a meter on what
voltages came out of the cartridge port it appeares that the logical
arrangement is correct. So on my STE with the cartridge port on the
left hand end,
<br>
</p>
<p>1. The small board is plugged in the cartridge port,
<br>2. The other board is placed to the immediate left so the ribbin
cable runs flat between the two.
<br>3. The NE2000 is plugged in with the face plate to the rear.
<br>
</p>
<p>And the while thing looks quit neat, as you can see here. The card
is connected to the STE, which is sat on top of the MEGA, and yes I
will make a case eventually.
<br>

<div align=center><tt> Abbildung 5 - Der komplette Adapter </tt>
<br>
</div>
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Note:(!nl) Watch the way of conneting the ethernet card to the
adaptor! Slot of the NE card must be into the back if the adapter is
placed as in picture on left side to the romport of the computer!
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>I actually put the thing together in small stages.
<br>
</p>
<p>* Firstly I plugged in the two cards, but with no IC and no
Ethernet Card and tested that the STE still workded and that the power
on the IC socket was correct.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>* Then I plugged in the IC and tested the STE still worked.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>* Lastley I plugged in the card and tested that the STE still
worked and the LINK light lit on the card when in the hub.
<br>
</p>
<p>You can also use the test programs provided in the latest version
of the archive. When you do note that some are designed to be run
without the NE2000 card in place but otheres require it. Also note
that HT3ENEC currently does not work so don't worry about it.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<br><b> The Software </b>
<br>Personally I think that this was the hardest part, however a
couple of factors contrinuted to this :-
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>1. My system boots AHDI 6.0 from a floppy as it has an IDE drive
and TOS 1.62
<br>2. My hard drive has an odd layout with many programs on
&quot;D&quot;.
<br>3. I have not used the ATARI &quot;in anger&quot; for a long
while.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Any way after an e-mail from Lyndon I decide to start using the
STING software stack. I downloaded this only to find the documentation
is &quot;HyperText&quot; format and I did not have a copy of ST Guide.
After some fiddleing I found that :-
<br>
</p>
<p>Which files are needed
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>1. Most of the STING software needs to be in &quot;C:\STING&quot;
where &quot;C:&quot; is the boot drive. Sting module have a type of
&quot;STX&quot;. Any unwanted files can be renamed to
&quot;.STY&quot;* I currently have the following in my
&quot;C:\STING&quot; directory :-
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>1. RESOLVE.STX
<br>2. TCP.STX
<br>3. UDP.STX
<br>4. ENEC.STX - This is the driver from the project ZIP file
<br>5. The CACHE.DNS and DEFAULT.CFG files are also needs to be in
this folder.
<br>6. The STNGPRT.CPX needs to be in your CPX directory to allow the
card to be anabled
<br>7. The STING.PRG and STING.INF files needs to be in the AUTO
folder.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<br><b> Configuring the System </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>In order to configure the system you need to change the following
entries in the &quot;C:\STING\DEFAULT.CFG&quot; file.
<br>
</p>
<p>* Lyndon recommends setting the &quot;Threading&quot; value near
the front of the file to &quot;10&quot;
<br>* The &quot;DOMAIN&quot; value may be set if required
<br>* The &quot;NAMESERVER&quot; should be set to point to your DNS
server. In my case the Router/NAT box provides a DNS proxy service,
and so it points at that.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>The C:\STING\ROUTE.TAB file also needs to be in edited. I use a
private class &quot;C&quot; network for my home lan of
&quot;192.168.1.0&quot;. The Router/NAT box is on
&quot;192.168.1.64&quot; and is the default gateway resulting in two
lines in the file.
<br>
</p>
<pre>
1.      192.168.1.0    255.255.255.0    EtherNet    0.0.0.0
   0.0.0.0        0.0.0.0          EtherNet    192.168.1.64

</pre>
<p>
<br>You then need to re-boot and call up the STING Port CPX. In here
you need to
<br>
</p>
<p>* Set the &quot;EtherNet&quot; device to be enabled.
<br>* Set the IP Address and SubNet Mask as appropriate for you
network. If you normally use DHCP then you should reserve this
addresses on the DHCP server
<br>
</p>
<p>If you then press the &quot;Addressing&quot; tab and switch to the
&quot;General&quot; view you should see the 12 digit MAC address of
the ethernet card. Exit this and if all is well you should be able to
use the PING and TRACEROUTE programs on the STING distribution to ping
other hosts on your network. All you need now is some applications
software to run on it......
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<br><b> Summary </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>I am very pleased with my board, and it seem to work very well.* I
currently have the free version of CAB for WEB browsing and NEWSIE for
News and Mail. I am also using GAPFTP to move files between my PCs and
the ATARI. I have not done any testing it seems much faster than PARCP
for moving files, and it has freed up the Printer Port on my PC for
other things.
