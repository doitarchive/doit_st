<p>Monitore SM124, SM144, SM146
<br>
</p>
<p>Der SM124 ist ein sehr kontraststarker 12&quot; Monitor, bei dem
etwa 10&quot; f&uuml;r das Bild (etwas klein) genutzt werden. Bei
diesem Monitor kann man von aussen nur die Lautstst&auml;rke, den
Kontrast und Helligkeit regeln. Der SM124 hatte von Haus aus keinen
Monitorfu&szlig;. Atari hatte aber f&uuml;r kurze Zeit einen passenden
Fu&szlig; im Angebot, der direkt am Monitor befestigt wurde.
<br>
</p>
<p>Es gab auch mal einen SM125 . Das war im Prinzip ein SM124, nur
mit Monitorfu&szlig;. Wurde aber nur in sehr geringen St&uuml;ckzahlen
verkauft und dann zugunsten der seperaten Monitorfu&szlig;-L&ouml;sung
(s.o.) aufgegeben.
<br>
</p>
<p>Mit dem SM144 kam dann als Abl&ouml;sung ein 14&quot; mit etwa
12&quot; nutzbarer Bildschirmfl&auml;che.(!nl) Ein wesentlicher
Nachteil gegenn&uuml;ber dem SM124 ist die wesentlich geringere
Kontrastst&auml;rke aber vor allem die Unschsch&auml;rfen im
Randbereich. Auch das Bild war meistens recht schief. Er hat aber auch
einen Vorteil:
<br>
</p>
<p>Man kann die Bildgr&ouml;sse ohne &ouml;ffnen des Geh&auml;usses
vornehmen. Dieser Monitor kam im Prinzip f&uuml;r den Mega STE raus.
Er hatte einen Monitorschwenkfu&szlig;, der genau auf die
&quot;Brotdose&quot; gepasst hat.
<br>
</p>
<p>Kurz nach dem SM144 kam der SM146, beide wurden sogar f&uuml;r
l&auml;ngere Zeit parallel verkauft. Er ist auch ein 14&quot; Monitor
mit 12&quot; genutzter Fl&auml;che. Er ist genau wie der SM144 nicht
so kontraststark wie der SM124, hat aber nicht das Problem mit den
unsch&auml;rfen und dem schiefen Bild wie der SM144. Auch hier gibt es
neben den Reglern f&uuml;r Helligkeit, Kontrast und Lautst&auml;rke
(alle 3 Regler vorne) noch hinten 3 Regler f&uuml;r H-Phase,
V-Gr&ouml;&szlig;e und V-Bildfang. Auch dieser Monitor hat einen
speziell an den Mega STE angepassten Monitorschwenkfu&szlig;.
<br>
</p>
<p>Alle Monitore werden inzwischen nicht mehr gebaut. Will man einen
Gebrauchten kaufen, sollte man vom SM144 ausser acht lassen. Ob SM124
oder SM146 ist reine Geschmacksache.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<br><b> Bildbreite- und h&ouml;he </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Von dem Poti f&uuml;r die Bildbreite und -h&ouml;he w&uuml;rde ich
generell die Finger lassen. Wenn die Bildbreite und -h&ouml;he
vergr&ouml;&szlig;ert wird, &auml;ndert sich die Stromaufnahme des
Zeilentransformators und beim SM124 hat das die Zerst&ouml;rung einer
Diode im Leistungsteil zur Folge. Sprich: Danach gibt es kein Bild
mehr.

<br><b> Monitorkabel </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Das Orignale Anschlu&szlig;kabel des Monitors ist ein spezielles
Kabel, es besitzt eine Koaxialleitung und einige normale Kabeladern.
Solche Kabel bekommt man ausschliesslich im Fachhandel. Zur Not reicht
ein d&uuml;nnes Koaxialkabel und eine 4-6 adrige abgeschirmte
Steuerleitung. Beide Kabel sind dann halt zusammen zu binden.
</p>
<p>
<br>Koaxialkabel:
<br>
<br>Mittelleiter mit Pin 11 des Monitorstecker (Monochrome) verbinden.
<br>Mittelleiter im SM124 mit Pin 2 von Buchse P301 verbinden.
<br>Der <a href="0f0b.htm" target="UDOcon">Stecker</a> befindet sich auf der Platine, die auf den
R&ouml;hrenhals gesteckt ist.
<br>Masse an Monitorstecker Pin 13 und und im Monitor mit Buchse P301
Pin 1 und Pin 3 verbinden.
<br>
<br>4-adriges Kabel:
<br>
<br><a href="1301.htm" target="UDOcon">Audio</a> ist gelb und liegt auf Pin 3 und geht auf Pin 1 am
Monitorstecker.
<br>Hsync ist rot, liegt auf Pin 4 und geht an Pin 9 Monitorstecker.
<br>Vsync ist gr&uuml;n, liegt an Pin 1 und geht auf Pin 12
Monitorstecker.
<br>GND ist schwarz, liegt an Pin 2 und sollte auch mit der
Abschirmung verbunden werden. (Schirm des Monitorsteckers)
<br>
</p>
<p>Wichtig ist die Mono-Detekt Leitung.
<br>
</p>
<p>Dazu ist im 13poligen Monitorstecker eine Drahtbr&uuml;cke von Pin
4 nach Pin 13 herzustellen. Wird das nicht gemacht l&auml;uft der
SM124 nicht und die Videohardware kann Besch&auml;digt werden.

<div align=center><b> MONOCHROME MONITOR FIX
<br>Randy Constan, Elfin Magic Co. </b>
<br>
</div>
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>If you have an ATARI SM124 Mono monitor that has recently gone
belly up,
<br>read on. In particular, this pertains to those of you who have
tweaked the coils and trim pots in your monitor to get a full raster
display,
<br>although it's quite possible that unmodified monitors have been
affected as well. Also, if do have a modified monitor that's behaving
fine, you still may want to consider the suggestions described in this
article, as it could save you a surprise monitor failure that (you
_KNOW_ ) will definitely happen at the worst possible time.
<br>
</p>
<p>Finally, this text describes a problem particular to the monitor
manufactured by &quot;Gold Star Co&quot;, which has the Brightness,
Contrast, and Off/On Volume controls recessed on the right side-panel.
There may have been other manufacturers of SM-124's with completely
different electronics, so if ANY of the physical component layout
descriptions written here do not seem to jive, then all bets are off
and the information given here may or may not have any practical
value. In addition, the monitor 'fix' I'm going to describe should
only be done by a trained electronic technician, or at the very least
a knowledgable electronics hacker with good soldering AND de-soldering
skills!
<br>
</p>
<p>Disclaimer: You can easily get knocked squarely on your butt by
the voltages present in your monitor. Weather or not it kills you
probably depends on just what you fall on, your present health, and
where the resulting flying monitor lands.
<br>
</p>
<p>In any case, your decision to implement the changes described
herein is completely your own. I disclaim all responsibility for your
health, safety, or any damage to equipment or property caused by
fires,
<br>implosions or explosions, earthquakes, global flooding, or
galactic imbalance resulting from your use of any information in this
writing. I think that about covers it ;)
<br>
</p>
<p>So... once upon a time, we all got our nifty HI-RES mono monitors,
powered them up, and the very first thing we all said was, &quot;Ah..
<br>MAN!.... This monitor is screwed up&quot;. Perhaps stronger
language was used, but the fact was that we all thought something had
to be wrong.
<br>Alas though, the tiny picture on that screen was exactly what the
ATARI mystics had intended! Of course, it wasn't long before many
daring hackers boldly removed the monitor's covers, cast their
warrantees aside, and discovered a way to expand the tiny picture to
full size. The information spread quickly through the worldwide
internets, spider- nets, and fish nets, and soon all mere mortals had
full screen displays and could actually read that 6 X 6 font! And so,
the all lived happily ever after. But then one day years later, a
curse fell upon the land, and darkness fell upon the faces of many of
these monitors.
<br>
</p>
<p>Ok, enough with the story narrative. By now, you're beginning to
get the picture (no pun intended). The modification to fill the screen
does indeed place an additional stress on a portion of the monitors
circuitry, which coupled with a design error quite common to many
types of computer monitors, ultimately caused the failure. The good
news is that I've now seen quite a few monitors with this identical
failure which is 100% repairable, and should leave you with 'good as
new' results. The bad news is that you do need some technical skills,
but even if you don't, finding a techie friend to help will be
abundantly easier having a possible procedure for repair.
<br>
</p>
<p>Brief technical summary. Right near the coil you adjusted to
spread the horizontal width of your display, there's a 2.2 uF
capacitor. More
<br>specifically, it is a non-polarized electrolytic capacitor, which
is actually 2 polarized capacitors wired 'back to back' in a single
enclosure. As the screen is widened, the peak voltage level across
this part increases, thereby causing more internal stress. This
situation is further aggravated by the type of part as well. All
capacitor types have certain advantages and disadvantages and when it
comes to
<br>electrolytic types, the advantage is smaller size. It's
disadvantage however is that at higher frequencies, it has high
'leakage' current and acts more like a resistor. The Horizontal
frequency passing through this capacitor is in fact quite high, and
the resistive qualities at these frequencies cause the capacitors to
generate significant heat. Over time, that heat will cause the part to
fail even in un-modified monitors, but the modification certainly
speeds up the process.
<br>
</p>
<p>If your monitor has fallen victim to this failure, in a way your
lucky.
<br>There's a fair chance that the problem (as said earlier) would
happen one way or another anyway, and at least now you have a possible
fix.
<br>First, you need to disconnect the monitor and open it up. If you
have the chassis I'm describing there will be two screws on the upper
sides, visable from the back; two more screws on the bottom; and a
single screw on the back above the power plug, which is a removable
'spade' type AC connector. After removing the screws, you can remove
the back cover, but be sure to be careful of the speaker connections.
The speaker is mounted to the inside of the cover, and connects to the
monitor's main PC board via a small removable plug. It's a bit tough
to get to, but trust me, it IS removable.
<br>
</p>
<p>Once the cover is free, there are 2 fuses to check first. From now
on, all references to right and left will assume you are behind the
monitor,
<br>with the screen pointing away from you. There is a small PC board
mounted vertically on the right side of the chassis which contains a
0.75 amp fuse. There's also a 2 amp fuse immediately to the right of
the speaker plug you removed on the main board. Check both fuses with
a DVM or other suitable instrument. Most likely, you'll find that it's
the 2 amp on that is gone, but either one blown is possible. You can
buy these tiny fuses at Radio Shack, and while your there, you can
pick up a much more modern replacement for the capacitor we mentioned
earlier. There's also a resistor that often cooks when this failure
occurs, so you might as well get all this stuff at once. If the
problem turns out to be something else, at least you'll be prepared
for the eventuality. In any case, read on to do a 'walk through'
before buying, to make absolutely sure your chassis physically matches
the one we're discussing.
<br>
</p>
<p>At your local Radio Shack, pick up the following items:
<br>
<br>
</p>
<pre>
          fuse      (pkg of 4)     3/4 amp             270-1048
          fuse      (pkg of 4)     2.0 amp             270-1052
          fuse      (pkg of 4)     5.0 amp*            270-1056
          capacitor  buy 2!        1 uF, 200v metal    272-1055
          resistor  (pkg of 2)     680 ohm, 1/2 watt   271-021

                    * optional purchase, see text.
</pre>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Since we have plenty of extra fuses now, start by just changing
them,
<br>and setting up the monitor (still uncovered) with your ST. If the
display comes up normally, leave everything powered up and wait a few
hours. If all goes well, you can either make the fix were going to
describe anyway to save future grief, or put the other parts away,
along with this text, in case the problem returns.
<br>
</p>
<p>Assuming the problem did not go away (no display and/or fuse blown
again), there are two paths you can take from here. You _can_ just go
ahead and change the suspected components without really knowing if
they are at fault, since they'll probably need replacement eventually
anyhow. The other possibility is that you don't want to to this until
you're a bit more sure it's necessary. If that's the case, read the
next few paragraphs. Otherwise, just skip over to &quot;Making the
Repair&quot;.
<br>
</p>
<p>If you do want to do some checking, here is a possible (but not
foolproof) procedure to see if the suspected capacitor is indeed the
culprit. If the 0.75 amp fuse on the vertical board was blown,
<br>temporarily replace it with a 2 amp. If the 2 amp fuse on the main
board has blown, temporarily replace it with one of the 5 amp fuses.
<br>Set up the monitor, still open, near your ATARI, and connect the
monitor cable to your machine. Boot the ATARI with the monitor still
off. We want to keep our 'powered up' time with the larger (wrong)
fuses to a minimum. Now, hook up the power cord and turn on the
monitor, being ready to instantly kill power at the first sign of any
unsafe condition such as smoke or electrical arcing.
<br>
</p>
<p>With the higher current fuses installed, the display will probably
still be out, but the green pilot light on the front panel _should_
light. If it doesn't, then either the new fuses have blown, or a
problem exists somewhere else in the circuit. Of course, the pilot
light could just be shot, but if the higher current fuses do actually
blow, then forget about the remainder of this discussion and just try
implementing the suggested repair. Also, if the screen display _does_
appear with the larger fuses, don't be to happy yet! Twice now I've
seen the 'crippled' capacitor seem to work fine for awhile before the
final breakdown. So weather the screen display comes up or not,
proceed to the next step as long as the fuses are not blowing.
<br>
</p>
<p>Locate Capacitor C714. It will be the round cylinder on the left
side of the main board (from the back), in-between the coil you
adjusted when you increased the width and the flyback transformer. The
coil is the only adjustable coil on the board, so you can't miss it,
and hopefully you know that the flyback transformer is the thing-y
with the wire that goes into the top of the picture tube! Locate the
capacitor... but don't touch it yet! The flyback puts out thousands of
volts, and if there is a flaw in it's insulation, it could arc right
into you hand.
<br>Just leave the unit powered up for a few minutes, and then turn it
off.
<br>Now, with your finger, move close to, and finally touch the
capacitor from the top. What you're looking for is a _HOT_ part, so be
careful!
<br>If in fact the part is really hot, it probably has shorted and
needs to be replaced.
<br>
</p>
<p>Also, immediately to the right of the coil, also on the main board
is a diode (D-709) and a resistor (R-221). Take a good look at the
resistor to see if it looks stressed or burnt. If you want, you can do
an in- circuit check with a DVM to see if it has opened. You can make
this measurement from the bottom of the board if you want since it's
pretty cramped on top. Even if it has not died, you should consider
replacement if it appears stressed, or the underside of the board
appears burned and discolored at the location of the resistor.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><tt> Making the Repair </tt>
<br>
</p>
<p>Making the repair is simply a matter of changing the parts, BUT...
<br>there's some special considerations here. You may or may not be
aware that radio shack does have 2.2uF, 50 volt non-polarized
electrolytic capacitor in stock! But using that part would be dumb
since the conditions that caused it to die in the first place have not
changed AND, the part was a poor design choice to begin with! We're
going to use the two 1.0 uF metalized film capacitors which are NOT
electrolytic, AND have a working voltage 4 times that of the original
part! We will have to parallel both capacitors to get 2.0uF, which is
reasonably close to 2.2 and in fact works just fine. First though,
you'll have to de- solder the existing C-714, which will probably be a
bit of a chore. Do that, and also get rid of the existing R-221 if it
shows the signs of heat stress (or is open) as we discussed earlier.
You can just cut it out if you want, since we'll be soldering the new
parts to the underside of the board.
<br>
</p>
<p>Now, take the two 1.0uF capacitors, and solder them together in a
neat parallel arrangement, that has a pair of leads bent to
accommodate the spacing of the leads on the original capacitor. Look
at the underside of the board and observe the original C-714 solder
pads, as well as the clearance to the bottom when the cover is
replaced. Give it a little thought and come up with a mechanically
sound and visually sensible combination. The capacitors again, are not
polarized so direction does not matter. And remember... parallel, NOT
series!!! Solder the parallel combination to the C-714 pads under the
board. Try to push the leads right into the holes left by the removal
of the old capacitor.
<br>
</p>
<p>R-221 should also be replaced from the bottom side of the board
unless you're really patient, and have some small tools. It's much
easier to just trim the leads and tack solder it in place under the
board. If the board looks a bit burned in this area, you may want to
clean it up a bit prior to installing the new resistor.
<br>
</p>
<p>Finally, don't forget to put the proper fuse values back into BOTH
locations. The original fuse values are important protection and do
not normally blow unless there is a real problem. I definitely do not
recommend leaving the larger fuses values in place. Do a bench check
on the ST again, still with the cover off. You may need to re-adjust
the horizontal width, or the position tabs on the neck of the picture
tube to center and set up the display. Once this is done, you can put
the cover back on, and you're back in business. If the fix does NOT
help, just double check your soldering and connections to make sure
you didn't wire something wrong.
<br>
</p>
<p>Hope this fix was helpful. If so, I'd like you to drop me an
EMAIL, since I'm curious as to just how many fried monitors out there
had this problem. Also, if you're not able to make the repairs
yourself and live anywhere in Islip, Long Island, NY area, send me
E.Mail and maybe I can help you out. My GE mail address is R.CONSTAN,

<br>
<br><b> Capacitor C714.. </b>
</p>
<p>Look for an electrolytic capacitor that is bulged, burned or
leaking brown stuff. Most likely located near the power supply
transformer. If it was an SM124 monitor, it would probably be the
2.2mfd 50 volt bipolar capacitor labeled C714. I've never had any
problem with an SM125 so am not sure what specific capacitor it might
be. The electrolytic capacitors do go bad with age though. Fortunately
they usually show physical signs of failure, and they are inexpensive.
