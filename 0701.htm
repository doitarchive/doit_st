<p>Nein, Sie finden hier keine Reparaturanleitung und auch keine
Innerreihen zu diesem Ger&auml;t. Ich hatte nie einen und ich brauchte
auch nie einen. Ein weiterer Grund warum sie hier kaum etwas finden
werden ist die Tastsache das die jenigen die einen haben nicht in der
Lage sind etwas dazu zu schreiben, bzw. an den <a href="0201.htm" target="UDOcon">Autor</a> zu senden. So
einfach ist das.

<p>Dennoch werde ich nach dem Portofolio gefragt.

<p><b> <a href="10.htm" target="UDOcon">Netzteil</a> verpolt? </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Der Portofolio hat keine Schutzdiode! Wird mangels originalem
<a href="10.htm" target="UDOcon">Netzteil</a> ein anderes <a href="10.htm" target="UDOcon">Netzteil</a> verwendet geschieht es oft das es falsch
angeschlossen wird.
<br>
</p>
<p>Auf der Netzteilsteckerplatine des Portofolio gibt es ein Bauteil
mit der Bezeichnung OK 9X oder auch OK 9Y, zumeist ist dieses dann
Zerst&ouml;rt.
</p>
<p>Auf der kleinen Platine befindet sich ein Transistor, 2SC3736,
Ersatz daf&uuml;r kann ein BC337 sein. Der Emitter an das Pad, das an
den mittleren Pol des 5poligen Flachbandkabels gel&ouml;tet ist. Basis
an das Pad, das mit der Z-Diode und den beiden Widerst&auml;nden
verbunden ist. Collector an das Pad, das mit den beiden
Widerst&auml;nden (anderer Pol als in obiger Zeile) und dem + des
Elkos verbunden ist.

<br><b> Filetransfer Atari / Portofolio </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>For those of you who would like to use the Atari Portfolio with a
SERIAL Diconix 150 Inkjet printer (and thus not have to lug a parallel
interface around) - here is a cable that will work. The cable diagrams
I got from Atari and from Diconix did not work.
<br>
</p>

<p>This is the minimum configuration of a cable that will do parallel
file transfers from a PC compatible to an Atari Portfolio. A 25 pin
straight-through cable works, but is too bulky for travel. This
minimum configuration cable needs only 6 wires. Both ends are male
DB-25 connectors, and the connections are straight across.
<br>
</p>
<pre>

  3  -  3        Data 1

                          18 through 25.  I used 18 - 18.)

</pre>
<p>For those of you who need a compact parallel cable for file
transfers and printing I have found the solution! Go to your local
Radio Shack and pick up the following items.
<br>
</p>
<p>2- male d style subminiature solderless 25 position connectors for
ribbon cable. Cat# 276-1599
<br>1- 36 position male printer connector (centronics) Cat# 276-1533
<br>1- package 25 conductor ribbon cable Cat # 278-772 (!nl9
</p>
<p>Assembly is simple. Insert cable into one of the DB25 connectors
and crimp together, I use a vice but a crimp tool is available. Cut
cable to desired length and crimp other db 25 connector to other end.
Be sure to match pin 1 on each connector to the colored edge of the
cable. The centronics connector crimps on about 1&quot; from either
end. Being sure to match pin 1 on the connector and the colored edge
of the cable.
<br>
</p>
<p>That's it! You're done. Now you can do file transfers or print
from any hardware with a parallel or printer port. All of the above
parts are available at the corner Radio Shack for about $15.00.
<br>
</p>
<p>If you need a serial cable you can just eliminate the 36 position
connector and use 25 pin female connectors Radio Shack Cat#276-1565.
<br>
</p>
<p>All these parts are available at most electronics stores I used
Radio Shack part numbers because I can always seem to find one when I
need it!

</p>
<p><b> PORTFOLIO -&gt; 8-BIT CONNECTION </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>In order to connect your 8-bit to the new PORTFOLIO computer, you
have to know three things;
<br>
</p>
<p>1. You have to have an RS232 interface connected to your 8-bit;
the 850, P:R: CONNECTION, or MIO devices all work well for the
purpose.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>2. You will need a null modem cable. This is a cable which
connects two computers without the need for modems (cutting out the
middle man, so to speak).
<br>
</p>
<p>3. You will need to make the null modem cable (or have a friend do
it if you subscribe to the ancient Code of the Programmer); &quot;Hey,
I don't do that, it's a hardware problem!&quot;
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br><tt> PART ONE: THE PROBLEM </tt>
<br>
</p>
<p>The PORTFOLIO has file transfer capability... through the parallel
interface. I don't know of any 8-bit aplication to redirect
communication software into the parallel port, so ignore the File
Transfer section in the SETUP application.
<br>
</p>
<p>The RS232 ports on 8-bit computer interfaces are not compatable
with &quot;standard&quot; RS232 DB-9 cables, (having been developed a
few years before IBM stuck their foot in the PC door); pinouts are as
shown below.
<br>
</p>
<pre>
         8-bit           STANDARD

           1 DTR            1 CD

           2 CD             2 RD

           3 TD             3 TD

           4 RD             4 DTR

           5 GND            5 GND

           6 DSR            6 DSR

           7 RTS            7 RTS

           8 CTS            8 CTS

           9 (none)         9 RI

</pre>
<p>Fortunately, PORTFOLIO's Serial Interface does conform to this
standard, so that modems and IBM AT cables can be used with it.
<br>
</p>
<p>One other problem; the diagrams in the Serial Interface manual are
wired wrong. If you intend to make your own standard cables, refer to
this service for the file detailing proper connections. (NOTE: this
file may be found in the ST sections of this service; for CIS, GO
ATARIPRO; for GEnie, type ST.)
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><tt> PART TWO: THE SOLUTION </tt>
<br>
</p>
<p>Well, Part One ought to have scared the willies out of all but the
most determined Solder-Jockies, so we can now proceed with our
interface.
<br>
</p>
<p>1. Get two (2) DB-9 &quot;D&quot; style connectors; one Male, one
Female. (NOTE: if you don't want to go through the hassles of
soldering, pick up the Radio Shack crimp-style connectors [CAT
#276-1427 &amp; 276-1428, respectively]; with these connectors, all
you do is insert the wires and crimp the pins closed.)
<br>
</p>
<p>2. You will also need hoods for your connections; I used the
metalized hoods [276-1513] for my cable, as they offer the shielding
ability of metal with the light weight of plastic.
<br>
</p>
<p>3. For the cable, I recommend [278-775] double-shielded cable,
especially for the MIO user; the PBI bus is flat-out full of RFI, and
the chance of data corruption from that monster makes the extra cost
worthwile.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br><tt> Connections are as follows </tt>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<pre>

</pre>
<p>Cable shield attached to PF hood ONLY.
<br>Double check your connections before connecting to either
computer.
<br>
</p>
<p>To test your interface, connect the cables to their respective
interfaces and fire up your favorite 8-bit term software (I've used
850 EXPRESS! and BOBTERM with equal results), and set the terminal for
300 baud, half duplex, ATARI. The ATARI mode will be important once
you start binary file transfer.
<br>
</p>
<p>For PORTFOLIO, go to the RS232 option in the SETUP menu, and set
300 baud, no parity, 1 stop bit, 8 data bits, and initialize.
<br>
</p>
<p>Force the TERM mode on your 8-bit.
<br>At the c&gt; prompt, enter:
<br>
</p>
<p>COPY CON AUX
<br>
</p>
<p>Type something in to your Portfolio, press ENTER: your message
from PORTFOLIO should echo on your 8-bit monitor. If not, check the
term program settings, connections, and cable pinouts.
<br>
</p>
<p>Congratulations! You now have a handheld computer that
&quot;talks&quot; with it's older brother. The advantages? You can use
your full-screen 8-bit for communications and D/L to your palmtop. You
can fill your Portfolio with programs without having to borrow
somebody's IBM.
<br>
</p>
<p>And, best of all, you can compute respectfully during the day, and
_still_ blast the bloody bejeezus out of ZYBEX at night.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> THE PORTFOLIO CONNECTION:
<br></b>
<br>
</p>
<p>ACKNOWLEGEMENT:
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>The following programs have been thoughtfully provided by Mr. Jim
Strauss and uploaded to the major computer services as ShareWare.
<br>
</p>
<p>Thanks Jim; check's in the mail.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><tt> PART ONE: THE PROBLEM </tt>
<br>
</p>
<p>So, you are the proud new owner of the latest Atari _wunderkind_
PORTFOLIO. You're going to use it as your portable terminal... work on
that major report during lunch, or figure out why the heck the Widgies
Division has lost money for the fourth straight quarter while stuck in
traffic... so you decide to get the RS232 Serial Interface... you
really don't need the Parallel Interface because all the printers you
have at work and home use the serial interface. You get the machine
home, break out the docs,... and find out that the Serial Interface
has _NO_ software for file transfer, and worse, the file transfer
program in the SETUP section uses... the parallel interface?
<br>
</p>
<p>Someone seemed to be unclear on the concept out there in
</p>
<p>Atariland...
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><tt> PART TWO: THE SOLUTION </tt>
<br>
</p>
<p>No, don't send nasty mail to the Mayor of Atariland... he never
</p>
<p>reads the stuff anyway.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>For those of you with 8-bit Ataris (the vererable 800, 800XL, or
the XE machines), I've left another file in the 8-bit section of this
service; to access it, just go to the File Transfer option of the
8-bit section and use the keywords MIO, 850, or PORTFOLIO; this little
file details how to make a null modem cable for the 8-bit computers to
&quot;talk&quot; with the PORTFOLIO. Other computer users may find
this file useful, as it has the pinouts and correct wire connections
for the PFSI (Portfolio Serial Interface); just adapt the 850 end for
your own make of computer (IBMers, all you guys need is a regular AT
null modem cable with a DB25-DB9 adaptor).
<br>
</p>
<p>THAT was the easy part; getting software in to the PF through the
PFSI is the REAL bear. So be warned: this project requires a great
deal of patience... a GREAT deal of patience. Those who fish as a
hobby will feel right at home with this project; those with CLASS A-1
volcanic tempers with nanosecond attention levels had better skip this
project altogether and pick up the Parallel Interface.
<br>
</p>
<p>For those of you still with us... into the abyss.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><tt> PART THREE: SOFTWARE NEEDED </tt>
<br>
</p>
<p>You will need the following software, available on this or any
major computer service or User Group.
<br>
</p>
<p>A. A terminal software program for your &quot;host&quot; computer
that allows text file transfers without CRC or return checksum bytes
from the receiving computer. 8-bitters; EXPRESS or BOBTERM work
equally well for this.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>B. CHKSUM.COM: a program for the PF that gives you a checksum of
the bytes from a PF program. THIS PROGRAM IS NECESSARY FOR THE
RETENTION OF YOUR SANITY.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>C. HEXBIN.COM: a program that converts hexadecimal text into
binary bytes - REQUIRED.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>D. TXMM2.HEX: a PF terminal ShareWare program supporting Xmodem
and Text Transfers, written in hexadecimal text. NOTE: DO NOT D/L
</p>
<p>TXMM2.COM unless you are going to D/L the program into your PF via
a Parallel Interface (PFPI); the reasons are given in the text below.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>NOTE: Be sure to capture the description header for these
programs, as these headers provide the CHKSUM number for each program.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>1. Enter the CHKSUM.COM program into the PF:
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>A. Type COPY AUX CHKSUM.COM into the PF. DO _NOT_ PRESS
&lt;CR&gt;!
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>B. Set your Host computer to Send Text. NOTE: Do not set your
terminal program for ASCII translation. Use the setting for
communication between two &quot;like&quot; computer types; IBM-IBM,
C64-C64, MAC-MAC. Otherwise the file will be corrupted (and the last
thing we need around here is a corrupt file).
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>C. Press &lt;CR&gt; on your PF before your host computer starts
sending the file.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>D. After the file has been sent, press ^Z (Ctrl and Z together) on
the PF, signalling the end of a file.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>This oddball transmission procedure is necessary because the TXMM2
program (in binary format) contains several ^Z bytes... which will cut
your PF file copy procedure short (NOTE FOR THE NON-IBMers: ^Z is the
IBM standard for closing a batch file using the COPY CON command. See
what you learn on these files?)
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>2. Check the checksum for the CHKSUM program by typing CHKSUM
CHKSUM.COM
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>If the computer locks up, use the WARMSTART procedure
(Ctrl-Alt-Del); if it does not reboot, then use the RESET switch on
the bottom of the PF, DEL CHKSUM.COM, and go back to Step 1.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>If you get a number that does not jibe with the number given in
the header description, you have two options; use the program, or DEL
it and go back to Step 1. The former is considerably riskier, though.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>3. Now that you have a working CHKSUM program, perform Steps 1
&amp; 2 with the HEXBIN.COM program.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>4. By now you should have two working programs; CHKSUM.COM and
HEXBIN.COM. Perform Steps 1 &amp; 2 again with the TXMM2.HEX program.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>5. Type the command: HEXBIN TXMM2.HEX
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>into the Portfolio. If the PF locks up, (that is, if you cannot
type on the PF after about 10 minutes), reboot and DEL the TXMM2.HEX
program as outlined in Step 2 and go back to Step 4.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>6. If the PF has not locked up, you should see the
</p>
<p>c&gt;
</p>
<p>prompt. Type the command HEXBIN RESULT.OUT into the Portfolio. If
the checksum is that of TXMM2.COM, then type REN RESULT.OUT TXMM2.COM
and congratulate yourself; you now have a palmtop terminal with Xmodem
and Text Capture capabilities!
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><tt> PART FOUR: Conclusion </tt>
<br>
</p>
<p>Congratulations; you have performed a task that would have driven
the ancient philosophers nuts. Go have a nice warm bath, pamper
yourself... you deserve it.
<br>
</p>
<p>After you have finished pampering yourself, make sure you copy all
three .COM programs to your RAM card (save for it if you don't have
one; it's as important as your host's floppy disks and a heck of a lot
sturdier). You can DELete the TXMM2.HEX program from the PF c&gt;
drive.
<br>
</p>
<p>NOTE: make a back-up copy of the programs CHKSUM.COM, HEXBIN.COM,
and TXMM2.HEX on your host computer's floppy disks; you never know
when your PF may have a memory lapse or when a miscreant program may
write over your PF programs, or when you may pass through a
memory-scrambling EMI field (like a university experiment or when your
5-year-old decides to use the Bulk Tape Eraser on &quot;daddy's new
toy&quot;.
<br>
</p>
<p>With this new program, you can successfully U/L or D/L between
your computers using Xmodem instead of T/E (Trial &amp; Error).

<p><b> Portfolio Hints and Tips </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>From the Atari A.P.B . Volume 2, Number 1
<br>
</p>
<p>If you want to get the current A.P.B. please send one U.S. Dollar
to:
<br>Atari Computer Corporation
<br>1196 Borregas Ave.
<br>Sunnyvale CA. 94089
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<br>The Atari Portfolio is a powerful tool. It will grow with your
needs and require only a basic understanding of proper computer care
for trouble-free use.
<br>
</p>
<p>The following are hints and tips for optimum productivity and
enjoyment from your Portfolio computer. Some users may consider the
suggestions as basic computer knowledge. Others will benefit a great
deal as they use the Portfolio more and more.
<br>
</p>
<p>* If you seem to have difficulties with Serial Interface file
transfers, make certain the Serial Interface is initialized. This can
be done within the RS-232 port option in the SET UP menu. Also make
certain the baud rates on both computers are set the same.Install
peripherals and Memory Cards only while the screen of the Portfolio is
turned &quot;OFF&quot;. This avoids occasional electrical static
during installation and better ensures that the operating system of
the Portfolio &quot; knows&quot; that these devices are installed.
<br>
</p>
<p>* If your batteries appear to offer unreliable operation, gently
tilt the Portfolio from side to side. Should you suspect that the
batteries may not be firmly in place, then responsibly bend the
positive metal connector in the battery compartment outward to induce
a tighter battery fit. Some &quot;AA&quot; batteries are slightly
different in length depending on manufacturer and job lot.
<br>
</p>
<p>* When installing batteries in Memory Cards, mark a date eight to
ten months later on the label in pencil. Reference that date for
battery replacement. This time frame should apply to all size cards.
If using a Memory Card (which is highly recommended), set the size of
your &quot; C:&quot; Drive to 8K. If you plan to use the
Calendar/Diary alarm functions, then set the &quot;C:&quot; Drive to
16K. From that point on, read and write your data files directly to
the &quot;A:&quot; Drive. Refer to the FDISK command for setting the
size of the &quot;C:&quot; Drive.
<br>
</p>
<p>* The Portfolio User's Manual will make no attempt to teach the
use of DOS, Spreadsheets or Word Processing. These subjects sometimes
justify accredited college courses depending on the level of expertise
you wish to apply. It is suggested that users visit their local
library or bookstore for books on these subject(s) if additional
information is required.
<br>
</p>
<p>* Using the Editor, write the following batch file and save it as
A:\AUTOEXEC.BAT. The line: A:\Update requires that an update program
be moved to your RAM card from the FILE MANAGER card. If you do not
have the UPDATE.COM program, then omit line 3 below from your batch
file.
<br>
<br>@Echo Off
<br>Prompt=$p $
<br>A:\Update
<br>Cls
<br>App
<br>
<br>* Some Portfolio manuals contain an error in reference to the
creation of a CONFIG.SYS file. The proper entries are as follows:
<br>
<br>FILES=20
<br>BUFFERS=32
<br>COUNTRY=00l
<br>
</p>
<p>* If a MEMORY FULL error is encountered, try changing the
BUFFERS=32 entry in the CONFIG.SYS file to BUFFERS=8 and warm or cold
boot the computer without the FILE MANAGER installed.
<br>
</p>
<p>* Once low batteries begin to disrupt operation, do not rely
entirely on an AC adapter. Replace low batteries immediately even if
the AC adapter is being used.
<br>
</p>
<p>* The BATTERY LOW message is encountered only under specific
circumstances. Do not depend on seeing it during the limited time that
the Portfolio is capable of detecting and displaying such a condition.
<br>
</p>
<p>* You may change the battery in the RAM Memory Card without losing
the data saved on the card. To do so, install the Memory Card in a
Portfolio while plugged in an AC adapter. Press a key to turn
&quot;ON&quot; the screen and replace the battery before the screen
shuts itself off. Conservative users may wish to copy the files to the
&quot;C:&quot; Drive as a precaution. The battery used in a RAM Memory
Card is a CR2016 and may be found in most electronics stores. You may
prolong the length of time before the screen shuts &quot; OFF&quot; by
occasionally pressing any key.
<br>
</p>
<p>* If you encounter a DEVICE WRITE ERROR while saving a file to the
&quot;A:&quot; drive, check the write protect switch. Make certain it
is turned &quot;OFF&quot;. This may also occur if there is not enough
room on the drive for the file or the maximum number of files in the
root directory may have been reached. If you installed the RAM Memory
Card while the screen is &quot;ON&quot;, the Portfolio may not know
that the card is installed. In that case, try to save the file on the
&quot;C:&quot; Drive. A warm boot may be required if the operating
system needs to be informed that the &quot;A:&quot; Drive is
installed. When numerous files are being used, create and use
subdirectories to store them.
<br>
</p>
<p>* A DIVIDE BY ZERO or SYSTEM ERROR may occur for a number of
reasons. If encountered, perform a warm boot and make an attempt to
copy &quot;C:&quot; Drive files out to a Memory Card. Even if the
operating system appears to be restored, perform a cold boot through
the battery compartment to ensure that the problem has been adjusted
internally.
<br>
</p>
<p>* The Portfolio will make every attempt to reload the last file
you used in each application. If an error occurs while the application
attempts to load the last file, delete the PERMDATA.DAT file within
the SYSTEM directory on the &quot;C:&quot; Drive. You may also change
your CONFIG.SYS file to set a lower number of buffers. Performing a
warm boot after doing so may release enough memory to load the data
file properly. You may also attempt to enter the application out of
the FILE MANAGER environment as the FILE MANAGER does require space in
RAM.
<br>
</p>
<p>* Many people misinterpret the SAVE YES/NO option when exiting an
application incorrectly. When selecting &quot;YES&quot;, the existing
file on disk will be erased and a new file is created. If the file in
memory is incorrect, incomplete or corrupted, the old data will be
permanently lost. It is suggested that you always answer
&quot;NO&quot; when exiting applications to avoid this possibility. To
save a file, use the F1 option labeled as SAVE AS and deliberately
name the file as you wish. The F1 window in all applications may also
be accessed by pressing the Atari key.
<br>
</p>
<p>* If you accidentally exit the FILE MANAGER and wish to have it
operating again, turn the Portfolio off, install the FILE MANAGER ROM
Card and type A:\fm at the system prompt.
<br>
</p>
<p>* Avoid entering and manipulating files within the SYSTEM
directory on the &quot;C:&quot; Drive. The only exception is the
DIARY.DRY file which must be in that directory if you wish alarms to
sound.
<br>
</p>
<p>* To determine the available space on a Disk, use the DIR command
from the DOS prompt. The CHKDSK command makes many calculations and
assembles groups of numbers which are often confusing.
<br>
</p>
<p>* The &quot;ON&quot; and &quot;OFF&quot; designations of the
Portfolio refer to full operation, not to complete power. A Portfolio
which is turned &quot; OFF&quot; must still monitor alarms, data, date
and time. This is important to know for expectations of battery
longevity.
<br>
</p>
<p>* The ADDRESS BOOK application may be used as a database for more
than just names, addresses and phone numbers. You may also establish
files for inventories, recipes and other subjects.
<br>
</p>
<p>* If you detect a periodic &quot;blip&quot; across the screen
while the Portfolio is turned &quot;OFF&quot;, check the display modes
within the SET UP menu. Make certain they are all set to normal or the
batteries will drain at an accelerated pace.
<br>
</p>
<p>* You may sometimes experience system inconveniences in the
operating system which can be enhanced or corrected. A small program
exists in the public domain called: UPDATE.COM. A copy of this file
may be found on the FILE MANAGER/TUTORIAL ROM Card. Later versions may
be found on on-line services and on the Atari bulletin board. If you
are experiencing problems which appear unexplained, obtain the latest
version of this program and run it immediately following a cold-boot.
See an earlier tip for automatically installing the UPDATE.COM program
using an AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
<br>
</p>
<p>* If you travel, you may wish to use clear packing tape and adhere
a business card to the bottom of the computer by identification. A
small address label might be placed on the inside of the battery and
expansion bus covers as well.
<br>
</p>
<p>* To add a blank line between two existing lines in the Address
Book, use the clipboard to &quot;cut&quot; a blank line you type at
the end of the record, move the cursor to the new position and
&quot;paste&quot; the blank line in place.
<br>
</p>
<p>* If the non-weekend alarms in the Diary are not functioning on
your machine, you may still simulate the same result by creating five
separate weekly alarms; one for each day of the work week.
<br>
</p>
<p>* The COS and SIN functions in the Spreadsheet sometimes return
internal calculations and not the answers anticipated. Test your
results when using these functions and use an alternative calculation
if the operation is not responding as anticipated.
<br>
</p>
<p>* You may enter almost any special character into the Text Editor
you wish. This can be useful to create custom batch file screens or to
mark specific positions for global search/replace routines when files
are transferred to a desktop PC. To enter such characters, enter the
NUM LOCK mode by pressing the Atari key while holding the Lock key.
The cursor will change to a flashing underline. Then, while holding
the Alt key, type the numerical character code (1-256; use the red
numeric keypad). When you let go of the Alt key, the associated
character will appear. To turn off NUM LOCK, press the Atari key once
again while holding the Lock key.
<br>
<br>
<br>FDISK
<br>
</p>
<p>SYNTAX: FDISK [n]
<br>
</p>
<p>Sets the size of the internal RAM drive. c:. to size n in
kilobytes specified. The minimum value allowed is 8K bytes and the
maximum is the maximum available internal memory minus an amount
required by the applications and DOS This maximum will be displayed if
you try and set too big a disk size.
<br>
<br>For example. the command:
<br>
<br>FDISK 16 [RTN]
<br>
<br>sets the size of the RAM drive to 16K bytes Use of this command
also performs a cold start All files currently stored in the
portfolio.s memory Will be deleted in order that the RAM drive may be
re-sized This command should be used with care.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<br><b> LCD-Controller </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Here's some info I've figured out on the Portfolio.
<br>
</p>
<p>I reckon the LCD controller is a Hitachi HD61830 (which I have a
manual for), or workalike. It has two ports, address and data, with a
dozen or so registers:-
<br>
<br>R0 - mode - display on/off, blink, cursor, graphics/text bits
<br>R1 - char pitch, high nybble rows - 1, low nybble 6/7/8 dots wide
- 1
<br>R2 - chars/line 2 - 128
<br>R3 - lines/screen 1 - 128
<br>R4 - cursor line 1 - 16
<br>R8,9 - display start (low, high)
<br>RA,B - crsr addr (high, low)
<br>RC - write byte
<br>RD - read byte
<br>RE - clear bit (bit # in low 3 bits, LB bit is bit 0, RH is bit 7)
<br>RF - set bit
<br>
<br>If you read from the address register, DB7 is a busy flag, which
should be checked before doing anything. If you want to read data, you
have to do a dummy read first. (ie write RA, check busy, write RB,
check busy, read RD, check busy, finally read RD). (write RA means
write 0AH to addr reg, value to data reg. You can set DX to 8011H,
then do an OUT (DX), AX) The cursor auto-increments on a read/write
(for bits also). If you want to change the cursor addr, low order
byte, you must set the high order byte as well (the Hitachi manual
says) (If you only change the high order byte, thats ok)
<br>
</p>
<p>The R/W routines in ROM looks very slow, as far as I remember
(they keep on setting DX I think). The <a href="080108.htm" target="UDOcon">CPU</a> runs just too quickly to
not need the busy checks. You can probably find an optimum number of
NOPs, I decided its easier to do the busy checks.
<br>
</p>
<p>If this is the right sort of info, and you'd like more details,
just say. I did a couple of routines that read and wrote the whole
screen in one go, disabling &amp; re-enabling interrupts before and
after. I was going to do some graphics stuff, but haven't got round to
it. (I used DOS to set graphics mode etc.)
<br>
<br>Here's some other stuff I worked out, of varying use:-
<br>
</p>
<p>All ports are between 8000H &amp; 807FH, in blocks of 10H, I
think:
<br>
</p>
<p>8000-0F show last key pressed (bit 7 = 1 means released) see below
<br>
</p>
<p>8010 } LCD { data } duplicated in pairs up to 801E,1F
<br>8011 } { address }
<br>
<br>8020 tone generator
<br>
<br>8040-4F - word - 1/4 second ticks ?
<br>8050-5F - word - always C202H ?
<br>8060-6F - byte - contrast level
<br>8070-7F - extender
<br>
<br>Control keys
<br>
<br>^2 - 00
<br>^[ - 1B
<br>^\ - 1C
<br>^] - 1D
<br>^6 - 1E
<br>^_ - 1F
<br>^bsp - 7F
<br>
<br>Key codes (the row value is the low order nybble I think)
<br>
<br>(This is incomplete, )|( stands for the Atari key, &lt;&lt;&gt;,
&lt;&gt;&gt;, &lt;^&gt; and &lt;v&gt; are the arrow keys)
<br>
<br>0 1 2 3
<br>0 )|( \d s \
<br>1 w p z
<br>2 1 4 &lt;sp&gt;

<br>e &lt;del&gt; ' 8
<br>f 9 ] k &lt;esc&gt;
<br>
<br>
<br>Hope this helps, I don't know anything about undocumented int 61s,
I've done a small music program, the tone generator is fairly
straightforward, also have several games programs (logical rather than
arcade) if you're interested. Also a fair amount of stuff on the
serial interface as I don't have a PC, only a homebrew machine, so
have had to do my own comms stuff. I'd be interested to know how they
know how to put up a 'battery low' message (maybe something at 8020H
or 8030H?)
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b> Open Up </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>O.K...
<br>
</p>
<p>For all you Hardware-Hackers-Who-Can't-Resist-Taking-Your-
Portfolio-Apart-To-See-What-Makes-It-Tick: It *is* possible to take
the LCD part of your Port apart WITHOUT breaking it...BUT... As you
all know: Messing around with your machine like this WILL, most
assuredly, Void Your Warranty! Having said that here we go. Yesterday
I watched Don Thomas take an old dead Portfolio LCD PC board out of
it's protective covering. This is how he did it (BTW, we didn't put it
back together, so no guarantees!).(!nl)
</p>
<p>*** NOTE: Read everything first BEFORE you try this procedure! ***
<br>*** Warranty will be voided if you try this! ***
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>The first thing you must do is peel the clear LCD screen cover
(the one with the words &quot;Portfolio&quot; and &quot;16 bit
personal computer&quot; on it) off. This cover is glued on, but the
glue used is a resealable kind so you can put it back. Be careful when
you pry an edge up that you don't mar or crease the flexible plastic.
<br>
</p>
<p>After you have carefully peeled the clear plastic LCD cover off,
you will notice two phillips head screws: one at the lower left of the
screen and one at the lower right of the screen. Unscrew these and put
them in a safe place. These two screws are security screws that hold
the LCD lid together.
<br>
</p>
<p>Now comes the scary part. Around the edge of the Port lid (where
the speaker and the LCD reside) you will see a seam. Insert a broad,
flat, thin piece of metal (say, the dull edge of a utility knife
blade) into this seam and carefully pry the front and back part of the
Port lid apart. It is held together with little plastic
&quot;catches&quot;: 4 on the the top and 2 on each side, none on the
bottom. Start prying at the top left and do a little at a time across
the top and down each side, but not the hinge edge. The reason that
there are none on the bottom is both the front and back of the cover
are securely attached to the hinge. This means that you do not want to
try and pry that section of the lid apart.
<br>
</p>
<p>It won't work and you don't need to get it apart there anyway.
<br>
</p>
<p>At this point, you will be gleefully looking at the inside of the
Portfolio lid. There is a PC board, a speaker and a ribbon cable that
connects the PC board to the mother board in the base of the Port. The
speaker is just floating in the PC board hole, so don't tip the Port
upside down or it will fall out. If you want to get at the speaker you
can gently pull the top of the PC board forward to expose the
underside (the top and bottom of the Port lid is still attached to the
base at the hinges). This is where the speaker wires attach to the PC
board. Be careful when you do this because the only thing holding the
PC board to the Port is the ribbon cable. If you want to remove the PC
board completely you must open up the base of the Port to get at the
other end of the ribbon cable. This is scary due to the delicacy of
the connector on the motherboard and I would not advise doing this.
<br>
</p>
<p>That's it! Your on your own as far as getting it back together!
Don and I didn't put ours back together. Just reverse the taking-
apart process. Once you see how it all comes apart you shouldn't have
any problem getting it back together. Once again, your warranty is now
void, but if you break it and want a new one, call Don Thomas and
he'll tell you how you can send in your old dead Port and some money
and he'll send you a new one.
<br>
</p>
<p>Good luck and be careful!

<p><b> Portfolio Tips </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>by
<br>
</p>
<p>Tony Thomas
<br>
</p>
<p>Compuserve #: 71541,3456
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>1) Although the Portfolio does not have the MS-DOS SORT.COM
command, you can easily use the Address Book to perform simple
alphabetic sorts.
</p>
<p>Simply place a blank line between each entry in your file to be
sorted, open the file in the address book, re-save it in the address
book and voila - a sorted file. The sort will be performed on the
first word in the first line. Enjoy!!
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>2) Using the Portfolio's Address
</p>
<p>Book as a simple flat file database manager: Since you can have
multiple address book files in the Portfolio, it is a simple matter to
use it as a database manager. Use the top line for the name/subject
and use the bottom lines for the actual data. The names/subjects will
be sorted automatically and can be selected using the Cards command.
You can make mini Hypercard-like stacks on the Portfolio!!
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>3) Using Batch files to make life easier: Instead of grueling over
the C&gt; prompt and attempting to figure out commands, place them in
a .BAT file and let DOS do the work. For example, a file called D.BAT
can contain the command DIR/P. To see the directory one page at a
time, simply type D and Return.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>4) To eliminate hard carriage
</p>
<p>returns in text exported through the Portfolio's smart parallel
interface, you can use a program such as Strip.COM or you can import
the file into First Publisher and Export it as a .TXT file. All the
hard carriage returns at the end of each line will be removed.
<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>5) If you cannot find an Atari AC
</p>
<p>adapter, you can use a generic AC adapter such as the HE+
Universal Adapter available at Best products. ($12.99) Only adapters
with a miniature power supply connector will work. Set the adapter for
6V and make sure the tip polarity is set for positive! An adapter
should be used when connecting the Portfolio to peripherals such as
the parallel or serial interfaces. They are really power hungry.

<p>SOFTWARE ALLOWS PORTFOLIO PALMTOP COMPUTER TO COMMUNICATE WITH
PAGING SYSTEMS
<br>
</p>
<p>SUNNYVALE, CA (April 24, 1991)
<br>
</p>
<p>One of the most exciting Portfolio palmtop computer applications
to hit the market has been announced by TekNow!, a Phoenix-based
company that specializes in communications and computer messaging
products. The firm's new text paging interface permits Atari Portfolio
users to send messages to any alpha-capable pager, anywhere in the
world. According to TekNow! officials, the SAMpage software and the
one-pound Portfolio palmtop computer have combined to produce the
industry's first mobile dispatcher.
<br>
</p>
<p>&quot;What makes this technology so exciting is the fact that the
applications are almost limitless,&quot; said Ralph Tomeoni, TekNow!
president. &quot;Users can range from municipal and government
employees to business and medical professionals-anyone who needs to
quickly communicate with others,&quot; he added.
<br>
</p>
<p>The complete paging/communications system consists of the SAMpage
software for the Atari Portfolio and AlphaBox or PageRouter, an
intelligent alpha front end for paging terminals. Once installed, the
system will send a message using the Portfolio's auto-dial speaker,
which will generate DTMF tones.
<br>
</p>
<p>The user simply selects the name of the person who is assigned a
specific pager from the Atari Portfolio address book, and enters the
message. The message is transmitted by holding the handset of any
office phone, pay phone or car phone next to the Portfolio's speaker
during the transmission of the message tones. The system's
communications module then calls the paging system and sends the page.
Tomeoni pointed out that a single message can be delivered to one or
many alpha pagers and added that the system is even capable of dialing
multiple paging systems.
<br>
</p>
<p>&quot;SAMPage and the Portfolio will open up a whole new world of
mobile communications and computing,&quot; said Tomeoni. &quot;With
this system, people will be able to handle business decisions and
opportunities more quickly and effectively. We're all spending more
time away from our desks and phones,&quot; he continued. &quot;With
the Portfolio and an alphanumeric pager, people can leave their
offices and still be instantly informed when messages are sent to
them, rather than having to wait until they return to the office to
check their electronic or voice mail.&quot; Tomeoni added that the
Portfolio is ideal for this type of use because it's small enough to
slip into a coat pocket or purse.
<br>
</p>
<p>About the size of a video cassette tape, the MS-DOS
file-compatible Portfolio operates on three &quot;AA&quot; batteries
or an optional AC adapter. The 16-bit hand-held computer has 128K of
working memory and includes everything a business professional needs
to enter notes and reminders or to store important addresses and phone
numbers. In addition to the Portfolio's built-in text editor and
address book/appointment diary, the system also includes a calculator
and a Lotus 1-2-3 file-compatible spreadsheet.
<br>
</p>
<p>Priced at only $299.95, the Portfolio has serial and parallel port
options, so information can be uploaded and downloaded from almost any
personal computer. With the options, information can also be printed
out or sent by modem across town or across country.
<br>
</p>
<p>Sold separately, the SAMpage software interface for the Portfolio
retails for $89.00, while the AlphaBox addition to any paging terminal
starts at $3,295.00.

<p><b> Weitere m&ouml;glichkeiten zum Datentransfer </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Zur <a href="1507.htm" target="UDOcon">Daten&uuml;bertragung</a> gibt es 2 M&ouml;glichkeiten:
<br>a) per Speicherkarte:
<br>
</p>
<p>Dazu brauchst Du einerseits eine Speicherkarte f&uuml;r den Pofo
und andererseits ein entsprechendes Kartenlaufwerk f&uuml;r den PC -
oder jemanden, das hat und f&uuml;r Dich die Karte beschreibt.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>b) per Kabel:
<br>Dazu ben&ouml;tigst Du zun&auml;chst eine serielle oder eine
parallele Schnittstelle f&uuml;r den Pofo. Diese werden rechts an den
Erweiterungsport gesteckt. Mit einem entsprechenden Kabel und z.B. der
Software Folitalk kannst Du dann Dateien direkt &uuml;bertragen.
<br>
</p>
<p>Um aber z.B. Turbo Pascal auf dem Pofo nutzen zu k&ouml;nnen,
brauchst Du sicher eine Speicherkarte (oder hast Du mehr als 128KB
RAM?). Ich habe das selbst mit einer 128KB Karte gemacht. Turbo Pascal
+ n&ouml;tige Dateien sind glaube ich um die 75KB. F&uuml;r Quellcode
und Programme brauchst Du ja auch noch Platz. Deshalb reicht die RAM
Disk nicht aus.

<p><b> Portfolio HPC-004 und HPC-006? </b>
<br>
</p>
<p>Kann mir jemand was zum Unterschied zwischen einem Portfolio
HPC-004 und HPC-006 sagen?
<br>Gibt es noch mehr Modelle?
<br>
</p>
<p>Auf dem Typenschild auf der Unterseite ist der eine mit
&quot;HPC-004&quot;, der andere mit &quot;HPC-006&quot; bezeichnet. Wo
liegen da die Unterschiede? Nur an der ROM-Version, oder auch an der
Hardware?
<br>
</p>
<p>Ist eigentlich ein Update auf eine neuere ROM-Version
m&Uuml;glich?(!nl)
</p>
<p>
<br>
<br>Bis auf die BIOS-Version ist bei diesen Ger&egrave;ten alles
gleich.
